# Assignment 02 Fall 2018 - Pointers

This assignment introduces you to pointers.

Here are some guidelines for the assignment.


# Assignment Etiquette
- Do not do this assignment in one sitting. It will overwhelm you.
- You need to do the assignment alone.
- It is strongly advised that you start working on the assignment the day you get it. Assignments WILL take time.
- It is better to submit the work that you have done yourself than what you have plagiarized.
- You may be called in for viva for any assignment that you submit.

## Coding
- Solve each question by implementing a function with the name indicated in th question..
- Follow the best programming practices as given on [`LMS -> Resources`](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/portal/site/684809f6-2cec-479c-8910-2f0b77a8793c/page/dccf5cb0-6a79-4411-ba15-ba6a63a507ea)` -> Common -> Coding Practices`. Failure in doing so will have your marks deducted. See grading rubric for details.

## Grading
- Submit code that compiles. Code that does not compile, i.e. compiles with errors, gets a 0.
- Grading is indicated in the included grading rubric, _Assignment_Rubric.csv_.

## Submission
- Due: 1830h on 24th of September on Github.
- Note the submission deadline above. GitHub logs submission time and late submissions will not be graded.
- Submission through other means, e.g. over email, will be ignored.
### Submission - WS section
- Follow the assignment sheet and _main.cpp_ in your GitHub repository. They have slightly different function names.
- Modify the _main.cpp_ file in your GitHub repository.
- Make it a practice to push every working version of your code right from the start, even if it doesn't yet fully solve the assignment.
### Submission - Other sections
- Every assignment you submit should be a single zipped file containing all the other files. Suppose your name is John Doe and your id is 0022 so the name of the submitted file should be JohnDoe0022.zip
- Make it a practice to submit your work, even if it is incomplete, 10 minutes before the deadline and then continue to submit updates.
